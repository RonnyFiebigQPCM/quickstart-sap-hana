## SAP HANA on the GCP Cloud

This Quick Start helps you deploy fully functional SAP HANA systems on the Google Cloud Plattform, following best practices from Google and SAP. 
SAP HANA is an in-memory relational database and application platform that provides high-performance analytics and real-time data 
processing.

You can deploy SAP HANA on SLES or RHEL.

The Quick Start offers these deployment options:

- Single-AZ (single-node and multi-node)
- Single-AZ, multi-node, high-availability

The following diagram illustrates the Single-AZ, multi-node option. See the [deployment guide](https://fwd.aws/dvDvB) for descriptions of the other two architectures, as well as best practices, step-by-step instructions, and customization options.
